# Octorag: Elevating Your GitHub Repository Queries

## Overview
Octorag is a sophisticated tool designed to elevate your experience when interacting with GitHub repositories. Whether you're exploring repositories, analyzing contributions, or extracting insights, Octorag simplifies the process and provides structured, actionable responses. It combines powerful data extraction capabilities with an intelligent agent-driven decision-making process, making it easier to navigate and understand GitHub repositories.

The tool processes user queries about GitHub repositories and intelligently decides which action to take, leveraging various integrated tools to gather the necessary information.

## Features
- Retrieve detailed information about GitHub repositories:
  - Stars
  - Forks
  - Open Issues
  - Contributors
  - Last commit date, etc.
- Search repositories based on:
  - Programming languages
  - Author
  - Topics
  - Repository metadata
- Intelligent decision-making process based on user queries to choose the right tools for the task.
- Output structured responses that can contain both textual insights and files (e.g., repository data, images).
  
## Architecture

The tool uses a combination of machine learning and tool chaining to provide accurate responses. When a user asks a query, Octorag:

1. **Analyzes the query** to decide which actions to take using a chain of thought process.
2. **Uses the appropriate tools** based on the analysis:
   - `gitIngest`: To collect information about GitHub repositories.
   - `executeNetworkxAlgorithms`: For running graph-based algorithms if required.
   - `humanQueryToAQL`: For translating user queries into actionable queries.
   - `fetchGithRepo`: For fetching repository details.
3. **Passes necessary details** to each tool and combines the responses into structured outputs.



## Installation

Follow the steps below to get Octorag up and running on your local machine:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/octorag.git
cd octorag

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Querying GitHub Repositories**: To query a repository and get detailed information, you can call the `processRag` function with the user's question.

   Example:
   ```python
   query = "What are the top contributors to this repository?"
   result = processRag(query)
   print(result)
   ```

2. **Tool-based Queries**: Depending on the query, the system will intelligently decide whether to fetch repository details, run algorithms, or perform other necessary actions.
